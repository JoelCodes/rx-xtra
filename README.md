# Rx Xtra

More Utility Operators for [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/)

## About the Library

I love RxJS, but there are a few operators that I often reach for that aren't part of the core library.  In other libraries, I'd be pestering the maintainers to add them, but this is RxJS!  There's no need to change the library, when we can just create functions, and if they're just functions, they can be released in their own packages!

This repo encapsulates a number of utilities released as their own npm packages, รก la Lodash.

### Creation Operators

* loop
* loopScan -- Coming Soon
* abortable -- Coming Soon

### Pipeable Operators

* fold -- Coming Soon
* safeMap -- Coming Soon

### React Utilities
